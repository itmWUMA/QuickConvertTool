## 1. Converter Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Add a data unit converter class under `src/converters/` with unit list and base-unit mapping
- [x] 1.2 Implement conversion logic using bit as the normalized base and cover decimal/binary prefixes
- [x] 1.3 Register the new converter in `src/main.py` so it appears in the UI

## 2. UI and Tests

- [x] 2.1 Confirm unit labels include both decimal and binary prefixes in the converter UI
- [x] 2.2 Add unit conversion tests covering bit/byte, decimal, binary, and cross-prefix scenarios
- [x] 2.3 Add edge-case tests for same-unit conversion and large magnitude values
